      </h2>
      <h3>GAME (HOME)</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the main part of the website and will consist of a text based game, this may sound ambitious but I have actually allready 
        completed this part. The page will consist of a console where the text for the game will reside. It will also have a series of pictures
        that illustrate the enemies and player characters. It will have many different types of buttons that will prepresent different actions
        that the player can make. It will also consist of a leaderboard that will connect with an online database and will dynamically refresh
        the data every 10 seconds to keep the data fresh.

      <h3>UPDATES</h3>
      <p>
        This page will consiist of all of the updates that I am adding to the game. It will have a list of updates and ways to categorize those 
        Updates. The Update Cards will have thumbs up for users to like what I have added. The cards will also have thumbs down to allow 
        users to emphasize the updates they don't like.

      <h3>FEEDBACK</h3>
      <p>
        The Feedback page will be a dynamic list of feedback that I have recieved about my game. This will give the an opportunity for 
        users to give me feeback on what they like and don't like about the game so I can improve upon it. This page will consist of 
        a list of feedback that I have recieved. Each feedback will have a thumbs up emoji that can be clicked to increase the priority
        of the feedback. There will also be a category sorting system that will allow users to categories thier feedback as well as sort the 
        list of feedback. Finnaly there will be a form that each user can fill out to provide feedback for me.
